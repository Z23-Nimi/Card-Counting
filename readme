# Card Counting

This is a simple web application that allows users to simulate a card game. Users can click on cards to add them to their hand, and the application will automatically calculate the value of their hand and the likelihood of drawing a card without busting.

## Features

- Interactive card deck: Click on a card to add it to your hand. The count of the card will decrease by 1.
- Hand value calculation: The application automatically calculates the value of your hand.
- Likelihood calculation: The application calculates the likelihood of drawing a card without busting.
- Recommendations: If the likelihood of not busting is higher than 50%, a recommendation to take another card will be displayed.
- Reset functionality: You can reset your hand or reset all cards back to their original counts using the reset buttons.

## Instructions

1. Click on a card to add it to your hand. The count of the card will decrease by 1.
2. The value of your hand and the likelihood of drawing a card without busting will be updated automatically.
